## Dependencies
`Linux` or `OSX`

`Python 2.7` for `PSFGAN` (We will update as soon as the parent source code of PSFGAN is updated to Python 3)

`Python 3.7` for `GaMPEN`

Python modules (including but not limited to): `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Astropy`, `Pandas`, `TensorFlow`, etc.
## Installation
Clone this repository and change the present working directory to `PSFGAN-GaMPEN/`.
